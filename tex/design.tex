\section{\pname{} Design}
\label{design_mainpart}

\zrdnew{In this section, we present \pname{}, an importance-informed three-tier prefix KV \zrd{caching and prefetching }system. }
%We first introduce the system overview of SPEC and then elaborate on its three key components.}
First, we describe the overall architecture of \pname{} (\cref{sec:overview}). 
\zrdnew{Then, we introduce an I/O-efficient technique to identify important tokens (\cref{sec:techa}). 
Furthermore, we propose a prefetching technique to mitigate I/O bottlenecks by overlapping computation and I/O ({\cref{sec:technew}})}.
Finally, we explain how prefix KVs are managed across three storage tiers 
to further reduce the latency when loading them into GPU memory (\cref{sec:techb}).

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}




We propose \pname{} to provide large storage capacity for prefix KVs while
ensuring efficient I/O accesses to reduce TTFT. The system is designed based on
three principles: (1) Using a minimal number of I/Os to identify the
important KVs within a prefix, allowing only the essential KVs to be loaded
during the prefill phase; 
\cp{(2) Since the I/Os for loading essential KVs lie on the critical path, we introduce data prefetching during model computation to mitigate the I/O overhead.}
(3) Since loading only important KVs could degrade
the efficiency of existing storage and caching systems, we optimize the
three-tier prefix KV management to improve cache hit
ratios and I/O efficiency.

\cp{Figure~\ref{fig:overview} illustrates the overall architecture of \pname{}, which consists of a data plane responsible for KV storage and a control plane that governs runtime data movement and computation scheduling.
In the data plane, all prefix keyâ€“value (KV) pairs are stored on disks in chunked form, while selected KVs are cached in either CPU or GPU memory. The two cache spaces are mutually exclusive to prevent redundancy. To mitigate I/O latency, essential KVs are prefetched during model computation to overlap data transfer with inference execution.}

\cp{The control plane manages GPU inference and includes three core modules: important token filtering (\cref{sec:techa}), data prefetching (\cref{sec:techc}), and prefix KV placement (\cref{sec:techb}). The token filtering module loads only a subset of key vectors to identify important tokens, reducing disk I/O. The prefetching module proactively loads critical KVs during computation to hide I/O overhead. The KV placement module manages KV distribution across disks, CPU memory, and GPU memory to maximize cache efficiency and eliminate redundancy.}

\noindent \textbf{Dataflow of \pname{}.} 
Assume that a request $S=[t^p_0, t^p_1,...,t^p_{m-1}, t^q_0, t^q_1,...,t^q_{n-1}]$ arrives.
$m$ is the number of tokens in prefix and $n$ is the number of tokens in the query.
$t^p$ and $t^q$ denote the prefix and non-prefix tokens respectively. 
First, given the request, \pname{} searches the radix tree to find the longest common 
prefix subsequence from all previous requests~\cite{sglang-arxiv23, chunkattention-arxiv24}. 
Let's assume the result is  
%$R=[t^p_{i}, t^p_{i+1}, ..., t^p_j]$, whose KVs are 
$R=[t^p_0, t^p_1, ..., t^p_j]$, whose KVs are
stored in GPU memory, CPU memory, or disk.
There may also be some prefix tokens \( NR = [t^p_{j+1}, ..., t^p_{m-1}] \) that are not in the radix tree, and therefore their KVs do not exist in the system.
Next, \pname{} employs the I/O-efficient ITF method to identify 
the important tokens within $R$ , assuming $R_{important}=[t^p_{t}, t^p_{t+1}, ..., t^p_s]$ 
%($ i \leq t \leq s \leq j$) is identified. 
($ 0 \leq t \leq s \leq j$) is identified.
If KVs in $R_{important}$ are not in GPU memory, they are loaded from disk or CPU memory. 
The KVs of unimportant tokens in $R$ are not reused and do not participate in further inference.
Then, the loaded $R_{important}$, the tokens $NR$, and the tokens $[t^q_0, t^q_1,...,t^q_{n-1}]$   
are sent into LLM model, completing the remaining computations in the prefill phase.
Essentially, $R_{important}$ plus $NR$ becomes the defacto prefix used in the LLM inference,
replacing the set of \{$t^p$\} in $S$.
%Finally, the newly generated KVs for the prefix token in $R_{important}$ are stored on disk, 
%and the prefix tokens in $R_{important}$ are inserted into the radix tree for future reuse by other requests. 
Finally, the newly generated KVs for the prefix token in $NR$ are stored on disk, 
and the prefix tokens in $NR$ are inserted into the radix tree for future reuse by other requests. 
The decoding phase remains unchanged, following existing systems~\cite{alluneed-nips17}.

% \wj{
\noindent \textbf{Importance metric.} 
In this paper, we use the sum of values
in each column of the attention weight matrix as the token's importance,
following the same method in H2O~\cite{h2o-nips23}. A higher sum indicates greater
token importance. Our system is also compatible with other metrics for measuring
token importance~\cite{scissorhands-nips23, flexgen-icml23, infinigen-osdi24}.
% }

%\pname{} uses a radix-tree~\cite{sglang-arxiv23} 
%to manage the mapping from a token ID to its location.
%When a user request arrives, it searches the radix tree
%to identify its prefixes shared with previous requests. 
%For each token in the prefix, we design different
%dataflows depending on whether the token
%is an important token. 
%(1) If a token is an important token and exists
%in the radix-tree, its prefix KV will be moved
%to GPU if it does not exist in GPU.
%(2) If a token is an important token but does not
%exist in the radix-tree, its prefix KV will be
%generated through the prefill computation and decoding
%(illustrated in Section 2.1). After that, it is moved to GPU.
%(3) If a token is not an important token, \pname{}
%will substitue its KV with the KV of one important token 
%identified by ITF in the subsequent inference to
%reduce the amount of data for loading/generating 
%prefix KVs.

%When a user request arrives, it searches the radix tree

%(1) If a token is not shared, its prefix KV will be

%(2) If a token is shared, it will be evaluated by the ITF 
%to determine if it is an important token. 
%If it is important and its prefix KV is not in GPU memory,

%(1) If the token ID does not exist in the radix-tree,
%indicating no shared prefix is found, \pname{} will
%insert the token into the radix-tree, perform a complete 
%prefill computation, split the computed prefix KVs into fixed chunks, 
%and stores them on disks. The stored prefix KVs are periodically 
%reordered and the relevant metadata are updated. 
%(2) If the token is found in the radix-tree,
%\pname{} will identify the location of important prefix KVs 
%in the multi-tier storage and move them to GPUs for
%further inference.
%(3) If a subset of tokens are found in radix-tree, indicating
%the current request has a partially shared prefix with
%previous requests, the system will first identify important
%KVs shared among the heads for the current query through ITF.
%Then, for the important KVs exist in the storage, they
%will be moved to GPU. For the remaining, they will be generated
%through prefill computation, along with all subsequent decoding phases 
%in GPUs. The prefix KVs including the newly generated KVs will be either 
%cached in GPU or CPU memory, or discarded (with a copy always retained on 
%disks). Their corresponding metadata are updated accordingly.

\zrdnew{HyperInfer utilizes the \technew method as described in \cref{sec:technew} (denoted as \textit{LAYER-WISE}) to effiectively prefetch important KVs fot next layer. We compare it with the history-based method (denoted as \textit{HISTORY}). The \textit{HISTORY}  method prefetches KV pairs for the next layer based on their historical importance, iand prioritize KV pairs that have been useful most often in the past.
